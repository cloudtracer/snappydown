# SnappyDown

WIP File system based implementation of leveldown with snappy compression.  Eventual goal is to have a production grade pure javascript implementation of leveldown with a companion module for multi-threading, forks and cluster communication.

Long way to go. Using memdown as a starting point to get things going.
